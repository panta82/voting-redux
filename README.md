# Voting Redux

##### Following: http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html

####Notes:

- Using `action`s const instead of strings everywhere
- Strings everywhere. Is there a way to use more literals or classes, so that IDE can help out?
- No debugger for node js. Server side babel = terrible idea
- `reducer_spec`, reduced repetition. Could reduce it more? (hehe, reduce)
